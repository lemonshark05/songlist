Homework #7. Putting it all together.

Step 1: There is a main method in the song class that can be run to view the UI;
The database is songlist.db.
Step 2: The UI is as followed:
Please select your option (you have 3 options):
  1. Display all songs, artists, and albums.
  2. Partially specify a song, artist, or album.
  3. Generate a XML file contains a playlist based on genre.
The database doesn't have enough data. So, the beginning choice is 2;

Please select your second option (you have 3 options):
  1. Song
  2. Artist
  3. Album
Follow the prompts to insert the appropriate data directly.

I use TheAudioDB and can find more information here: https://www.theaudiodb.com/api_guide.php;
After adding the data of 1.song and 3.album, you can choose to display the data of songlist and generate an XML list.
